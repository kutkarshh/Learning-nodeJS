## Introduction
This repository contains projects that demonstrate my learning journey with NodeJS. The goal was to get hands-on experience with various aspects of full-stack development, including backend frameworks, databases, authentication, and cloud deployment.

## Projects

### Blogosaurus
**Blogosaurus** is a full-fledged blogging platform where users can create accounts, sign in, write blogs, comment on blogs, and manage their profiles. 

- **Features:**
  - User authentication (Sign up, Sign in, and Logout)
  - Blog creation, editing, and deletion
  - Commenting on blog posts
  - Responsive design using Bootstrap
  - Image uploads for profile pictures and blog cover images
- **Technologies Used:**
  - Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
  - Backend: Node.js, Express.js
  - Database: MongoDB
  - Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)
  - File Uploads: Multer
- **Live Demo:** [Blogosaurus](http://blogosaurus.ap-south-1.elasticbeanstalk.com)

### URL Shortener
**URL Shortener** is a simple application that allows users to shorten long URLs. It demonstrates basic CRUD operations and URL management.

- **Features:**
  - URL shortening
  - Redirection from shortened URLs to original URLs
  - Basic analytics (clicks, creation date)
- **Technologies Used:**
  - Backend: Node.js, Express.js
  - Database: MongoDB
- **Live Demo:** (Add URL if hosted)

## Technologies Used
In these projects, I have explored and implemented the following technologies:
- **Node.js:** For building server-side applications
- **Express.js:** For routing and handling HTTP requests
- **MongoDB:** For database management
- **JWT:** For user authentication
- **Multer:** For file uploads
- **Bootstrap:** For responsive design

## Learning Goals
- **Backend Development:** Deepened understanding of server-side programming with Node.js and Express.js.
- **Database Management:** Gained experience with MongoDB for data storage and management.
- **Authentication:** Implemented JWT for securing user authentication and sessions.
- **File Handling:** Learned how to handle file uploads using Multer.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Deployed applications to AWS Cloud for practical experience with cloud services.
